# Workspaces: 

- Terraform workspaces are a feature that allows you to manage multiple environment of your infrastructure within a single configuration. Each workspace represents a separate state file, allowing you to manage and isolate different environments or configurations without duplicating your Terraform configuration files

- Isolation: Each workspace has its own state file, means we doing changes on one environment it will not affect on other environment. both will isolate from one another.This isolation allows you to safely test changes or manage different environments (such as dev, stg, prod) within the same Terraform configuration.

- Variables in workspace: Workspaces have thier own set of variables value. this allow to customize the infrastructure.

- State file: Workspace automatically manage the state file for the each environment/workspaces, ensuring that changes made in one workspace are tracked separately from changes in others. This prevents conflicts and makes it easier to manage state files in a collaborative environment.

- Switch workspace: we can switch workspace by using command ```terraform workspace select```. this allow us to apply changes on specific environment.
