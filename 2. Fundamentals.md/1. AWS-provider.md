# AWS Provider in Terraform:

- In Terraform, a provider is a plugin that interacts with cloud providers, third-party tools, and other APIs. To use Terraform with AWS, you use the AWS provider ,
  which interacts with AWS resources.

- If you want to use Terraform to create a S3 bucket on AWS, you would need to use the aws provider. The aws provider provides a set of resources that Terraform can use to create, manage,
  and destroy S3 bucket on AWS.

as per below we can use the AWS provider in Terraform .tf file
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"

  tags = {
    Name        = "My bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
```
In this example, we are first defining the aws provider. We are specifying the region as us-east-1. Then, we are defining the S3 bucket resource. 
We are specifying the name and environment as well.
