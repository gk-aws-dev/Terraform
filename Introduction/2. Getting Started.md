# Getting started
to get start with terraform we have to understand some key concept need to install the teraform on your machine.

**1. Infrastructure as code :** Terraform is the Infrastructure as code means you can define/create your infra using code rather than manual process.

**2. Terraform Language :** Terraform used thier own configuration language call HCL. HCL will allows you to describe your infra in configuration file. often its with ```.tf``` extension.

**3. Resource :** Resource can define the component of the your infrastructure. they represent the resource/services from your cloud platform, such as db, vm, network, etc. all resource has their own properties and attributes.

**4. Provider:** Terraform interacts with various infrastructure providers such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and many others

**5. State File:** Terraform maintains a state file (often named ```terraform.tfstate```) that keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure. This file is crucial for Terraform to understand what resources have been created and what changes need to be made during updates. its can work as a version controlling.

**6. Variable:** ```Variable.tf``` file we can use to create to define the attributes for the resource. we can pass those value in the main.tf file according to the environmant (dev/stg/prod).

**7. Output:** Outputs are values generated by Terraform after the infrastructure has been created or updated. Outputs are typically used to display information or provide values to other parts of your infrastructure stack. it mainly the ```output.tf``` file.

**8. Terraform Lifecycle:** Terraform provides several commands for managing your infrastructure, including terraform init, terraform plan, terraform apply, terraform destroy, etc. These commands allow you to initialize your Terraform configuration, create execution plans, apply changes to your infrastructure, and destroy resources when they're no longer needed.
