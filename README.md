# Introduction of Terraform:
- Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.
 - Terraform enables users to manage and automate the deployment and scaling of infrastructure across various cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others, as well as on-premises infrastructure.
- HashiCorp and the Terraform community have already written thousands of providers to manage many different types of resources and services.
