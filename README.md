# Terraform
# Introduction:
- Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.
 - Terraform enables users to manage and automate the deployment and scaling of infrastructure across various cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others, as well as on-premises infrastructure.
- HashiCorp and the Terraform community have already written thousands of providers to manage many different types of resources and services.

***Why terraform :***
- Manage any infra or any provider
- track your infra with state file, terraform uses the state file to determine the changes to make to your infrastructure so that it will match your configuration			                            - - automate changes: Terraform configuration files are declarative, meaning that they describe the end state of your infrastructure. You do not need to write step-by-step instructions to create 
  resources because terraform handles the underlying logic
- standardize configuration - Terraform supports reusable configuration components called modules that define configurable collections of infrastructure, saving time and encouraging best practices. 
  You can use publicly available modules from the Terraform Registry or write your own.
